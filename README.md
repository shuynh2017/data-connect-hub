# Data Connect Hub

Data Connect Hub (DCH) is a middleware service that provides a single integration point for ingesting data from multiple heterogeneous data sources. Rather than each consuming service maintaining its own client library stacks for S3, HDFS, NFS, relational databases, and others, DCH centralises connection metadata management and exposes data through two purpose-built APIs.

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.96+
- PostgreSQL (for integration testing, for `make container-run-flight`). The default URL in `flight-service/sample/config.toml` is `"postgresql://dch_user:dch_password@localhost:5432/dch_db"`, so you need to create a user `dch_user`, with `dch_password` as password, and `dch_db` database.
- Podman or Docker (for container builds)

## Getting Started

```sh
# Build all crates
make build

# Run all tests
make test

# Format and lint
make fmt
make lint
```

### Running the Services

```sh
# REST service (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
cargo run -p rest-service -- --port 8080

# Flight service (default: 127.0.0.1:50051)
cargo run -p flight-service
```

## REST API

| Method | Path                                       | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| GET    | `/v1/data/connections`                     | List all connections     |
| GET    | `/v1/data/connections/{namespace}`          | List by namespace        |
| GET    | `/v1/data/connections/{namespace}/{name}`   | Get a specific connection|

## Container Images

Each service has its own `Containerfile` with multi-stage builds and dependency caching.

```sh
# Build individual images
make container-flight
make container-rest

# Build all
make container-all

# Run
make container-run-flight
make container-run-rest
```

## Make Targets

Run `make help` for the full list. Key targets:
